About
=====

Extend the FORMULA library with numerical expression and numerical APRON
abstract domains.

Can be seen more simply as an extension of the APRON abstract domain for
dealing with Boolean and finite-type variables, in addition to numerical
variables.

- Combined finite-type and numerical expressions 

- Abstract domain for finite type and numerical types, implemented as MTBDDs
  with Boolean decisions and APRON abstract values as leaves.

Required
========
C  libraries: 
  GMP (http://gmplib.org)
  MPFR (http://www.mpfr.org/)
  CUDD (http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/)
   only for bddapron:
  GMP (http://gmplib.org)
  MPFR (http://www.mpfr.org/)
  APRON (http://apron.cri.ensmp.fr/library/)
C/OCaml libraries
  mlcuddidl, mlgmpidl (only for bddapron) (http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/mlxxxidl/)
OCaml libraries
  camllib (http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/bjeannet/pkg/camllib)

To configure
============
- copy Makefile.config.model into Makefile.config
- set properly the flags (mainly directories).

To compile the library:
=======================
make all # for bytecode and nativecode compilation of bddapron

To install the library:
=======================
make install
