(** Finite & numerical expressions/properties on top of CUDD & APRON *)

(**
Expressions and abstract domains combining finite-type and numerical types.
- {!Env}: environment defining finite-type variables and user-defined
  enumerated types, and mapping them to BDDs indices;
- {!Cond}: environment defining numerical conditions, and mapping them to
  BDDs indices;
- {!Expr0}: general finite-type and numerical expressions;
- {!Domain0}: abstract domains combining {!Cudd} BDDs and {!Apron} numerical
  abstract domains; two implemented combinations: {!Bdddomain0}, {!Mtbdddomain0};
- {!Expr1}, {!Domain1}, {!Bdddomain1}, {!Mtbdddomain1}: incorporate normalized environments;
- {!Expr2}: incorporates in addition normalized condition environment
- {!Syntax}: Abstract Syntax Tree for expressions
- {!Parser}: converting strings to expressions

{!Bddapron} extends {!Bdd} (manipulation of finite-type formula using BDDs)
and {!Apron} (numerical abstract domain library). It enables formula of
numerical type, and it allows decisions on numerical constraints in formula.

It can be seen as an extension of the
{{:http://apron.cri.ensmp.fr/library/}APRON} abstract domain for dealing with
Boolean and finite-type variables, in addition to numerical variables.
